## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues or Suggesting Enhancements

Found a bug? Have a new idea? We'd love to hear from you!

- Simply [create a new issue](https://github.com/syncinsect/tailware/issues/new)
- Describe the problem you've encountered or your idea
- If possible, include screenshots or GIFs to help explain your point

Don't worry about the format or whether it's "formal" enough - we value your ideas and feedback more than anything.

### Submitting Code

Want to improve the code directly? Awesome!

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request

Not sure where to start? Check out issues labeled "good first issue" - these are usually easier tasks to get started with.

### Improving Documentation
